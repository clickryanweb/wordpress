Yes, you can safely clear the rewrite_rules option in the wp_options table of a WordPress database. The rewrite_rules are regenerated automatically when you visit the Settings > Permalinks page in the WordPress admin and save your permalink structure.

Steps:
Backup your database before making any changes, just in case.

Run the following SQL query to delete the rewrite_rules:


	DELETE FROM wp_options WHERE option_name = 'rewrite_rules';


After deleting the entry, go to Settings > Permalinks in your WordPress admin and click Save Changes. This will regenerate the rewrite_rules.

This process is safe because the rewrite rules will be recreated, ensuring that your site's URL structure works as expected.
